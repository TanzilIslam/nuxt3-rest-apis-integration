        'Storytelling has the power to engage, influence, teach and inspire listeners. That’s the reason I strongly advocate the professionals to build a storytelling culture and make storytelling the heart of their leadership and communication skills. There’s an art to telling a good story, and we all know a good story when we hear one. But there’s also a science behind the art of storytelling. Confusing!! Whether Storytelling is an art that can be learnt or a science that can be reproduced or is it both? “Researchers have found that the human brain has a natural affinity for narrative construction,” science journalist Benedict Carey wrote in  New York Times Magazine . “People tend to remember facts more accurately if they encounter them in a story rather than in a list, studies find; and they rate legal arguments as more convincing when built into narrative tales rather than on legal precedent.” Take for example, you have attended a long strategic meet where lots of facts and figures are presented with some stories here and there. When asked, the participants afterwards, just 5% could recite a statistic while 63% remembered the story. Research also shows our brains are not hard-wired to understand logic or retain facts for very long. Our brains are wired to understand and retain stories. Storytelling is about the exchange of ideas, about growth – and that’s learning. That’s why I believe that it’s important that we embed storytelling in our corporate cultures and in our businesses. If you’re trying to engage, influence, teach, or inspire others, you should be telling or listening to a story, and encouraging others to tell a story with you. You’ll have plenty of science to back you up. This course help businesses/executives like yours to connect people through stories. We show you how to discover, craft and tell stories that move people. As a result, you make decisions faster and take action. Through this course participants will learn to find their authentic voice as a leader, refine their message and craft their stories. They will discover their innate charisma so that they can inspire and move their people into action.',

I also included the files needed in different parts of the course for you to follow along with me step by step. Here is what you are going to learn, first of all, I am going to introduce you to the tools that we are going to be using in this course. And then we are going to build a full authentication system from scratch. While building this system I am going to introduce you to hashing and dehashing passwords. And then, we are going to build general and cool features inside our own app. It’s going to be mainly on selecting and placing data. The next step is showing how a booking system is created professionally and then we are going to move to one of the most crucial things in this course and that’s Processing the payment with Paypal in the easiest yet most efficient way possible. And then, we are going to build a search form to search for booking deals with multiple inputs. After this, we are going to move to the next part and that’s the admin panel. In the admin panel, we are going to finish up every part of our website. We are going to complete the admins, countries, cities, and book parts. So it’s going to be fun!! Of course, there is a lot to talk about, but this is just a short description of the course. So if you like it, what are waiting for? Get it now!!',

        'Learn a straightforward way to build a real  Fullstack web application with ReactJS & NextJS! Next.js  gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, etc. No config is required. Next.js  is the production-ready, framework for  ReactJS ! Data fetching in Next.js allows you to render content in different ways. These include pre-rendering with  Server-side Rendering  or  Static Generation , and updating or creating content at runtime with  Incremental Static Regeneration . It can make your applications very fast! During the course, we’ll cover the most important topics. There’re presented  TDD or TLD approaches  that I’ll try to practice with you during the coding sessions. Probably you don’t have enough experience with the tests, but it’s ok, there’s still an excellent way to learn it from the course. When you work with code and cover it with test cases, it provides you with guarantees that your code works as you expected. This is the purpose and benefit of the tests. \nTools for testing:  Jest, React Testing Library Storybook is the most popular way to build the components library. From our side, it’s the most basic part of the course. We’ll install and configure Storybook, which will provide us with a full components spec. This approach is called Components Driven Development. CSS-IN-JS, EmotionJS, and Styled-Components  are very powerful toolkits to build UI components. Even very complex component styles can be easily produced and supported by it. We create Dark and Light modes for your application with EmotionJS and styled-components API and NextJS! GitHub Actions  makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want. We create our deployment workflow! Last but not least it’s  Redux . Redux is a beautiful way to manage an application state.  We’ll use the Redux-Toolkit library  – it simplifies the work with Redux. Check out the full curriculum and free preview videos.

This hands-on process enables analysts to understand malware functionality, purpose, and potential impact. To achieve this, security teams use malware analysis tools. They typically rate and score specific malware samples in a closed environment called a sandbox. Malware analysis is the study or process of determining the function, origin, and potential impact of a particular malware sample, such as a virus, worm, Trojan horse, rootkit, or backdoor. Malware, or malicious software, is any computer software designed to impair the operation of a host computer, steal a system, or steal sensitive data from a user, organization, or company. Malware may include software that collects user information without permission. In this course you will learn the basics of malware analysis. It’s a course for total beginners, not for people already familiar with cyber security concepts. If you are interested in Cyber Security, but don’t know where to start, this course is for you. You will learn the basics of malware analysis. Given any file, you will be able to say if it is potential malware or not. You will understand how virus scanners find malware.',
