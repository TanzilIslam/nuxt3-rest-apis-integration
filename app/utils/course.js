      'Navigating Application Updates and Deadlines at University of Nebraska Omaha: Your Comprehensive Guide',
    content:
      "<h4>Introduction:</h4><p>Are you considering pursuing your undergraduate or graduate studies at the University of Nebraska Omaha? Ensuring a smooth application process is crucial, especially with recent updates and deadlines. In this blog post, we'll delve into the latest application and admissions updates, important dates to remember, and essential tips to enhance your chances of success.</p><h4>Latest Application and Admissions Updates:</h4><p>As of March 2024, significant changes have been implemented regarding funding support for incoming graduate students. The International Graduate Scholarship has been eliminated, with the primary financial assistance now available through competitively awarded graduate assistantships, either in research or teaching roles.</p><p>For both undergraduate and graduate applicants, it's imperative to submit applications directly to the University of Nebraska Omaha. This streamlined process ensures that your application is promptly reviewed and tagged with the appropriate agency.</p><p>Moreover, all graduate applicants must include a course-by-course transcript evaluation from recognized organizations such as SpanTran, WES, ECE, or Educational Perspectives. Applications will not undergo review until this credential evaluation has been submitted. Delays often occur when applicants overlook this requirement, so be sure to double-check your submission to avoid setbacks.</p><p>Remember, if it's been more than four weeks without an application update, it's advisable to verify whether the applicant has fulfilled the course-by-course credential evaluation. This step is crucial in expediting the review process and ensuring timely feedback.</p><h4>Important Dates to Remember:</h4><p>For prospective students eyeing the Fall 2024 intake, mark your calendars with these key deadlines:</p><ul><li>Undergraduate Deadline: July 1, 2024</li><li>Graduate Deadlines (Varies By Program):<ul><li>Computer Science: May 1</li><li>MBA: June 1</li><li>Management Information System &#40;MIS&#41;: July 1</li><li>Data Science: July 1</li><li>Cybersecurity: July 1</li><li>Biomedical Informatics: July 1</li></ul></li></ul><p>Additionally, for those considering a spring semester start in 2025:</p><ul><li>Spring 2025 Undergraduate Applications are now open, with a deadline of December 1.</li><li>Spring 2025 Graduate Applications will open in early July.</li></ul><h4>Tips for Success:</h4><p>To enhance your chances of securing admission to the University of Nebraska Omaha, consider the following tips:</p><ol><li>Plan Ahead: Familiarize yourself with program requirements and deadlines well in advance to avoid last-minute rushes.</li><li>Gather Required Documents: Ensure you have all necessary documents, including transcripts and credential evaluations, ready for submission.</li><li>Seek Funding Opportunities: With the International Graduate Scholarship eliminated, explore alternative funding sources and consider applying for graduate assistantships.</li><li>Submit Complete Applications: Double-check your application to ensure all required fields are completed, and all supporting documents are included.</li><li>Stay Organized: Keep track of application progress and deadlines using a calendar or planner to avoid missing important dates.</li></ol><h4>Conclusion:</h4><p>Navigating the application process for undergraduate and graduate programs at the University of Nebraska Omaha requires careful attention to detail and adherence to deadlines. By staying informed about the latest updates, submitting complete applications, and meeting deadlines, you can increase your chances of securing admission to your desired program. Start planning early, and best of luck on your academic journey!</p>",

Your classes will cover topics such as general linear models, statistical methods, statistical theory, and data management and analysis. Then, you'll take a series of pre-doctoral, public health seminars and non-quantitative electives in areas like biology or medicine. We'll also have electives that focus on epidemiologic research methods and topics within the field of biostatistics for you to choose from. Before you complete the program, you'll complete a non-thesis research project and present it to a graduate committee. Finally, we'll offer you the chance to participate in hands-on learning experiences while you're here.",

Candidates continue Thesis development through Thesis Studio courses taken in the Fall and Winter quarters of their third year. In addition to work completed in the Thesis Studio courses students are required to provide quarterly evidence of progress, iteration, and refinement to their Thesis committee in the form of playable prototypes, proof of concept papers, or other appropriate means.
